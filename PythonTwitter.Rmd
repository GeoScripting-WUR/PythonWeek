# Harvesting tweets with Python

As background knowledge it is assumed that you know what a JSON is. If not, have a look at [JSON Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp). Also acquaint yourself yourself with the datastructure of tweets. You can find it on [API Tweets](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets). Try to find out for example where spatial references are made in a tweet.

# Assignment 14

Create a twitter harvesting application that harvests tweets (either real-time or stored), and create a spatial dataset and map from it. 
The application should be able to: collect tweets based on a thematic and/or spatial query. 

Suggestions:

* Feed a spatial database with information tweeted real time from a certain location and plot it on a map.
* Create a map indicating where traffic jams, disruptions in the public transport or ... took place last week.
* Create a map indicating the home countries of international tourists visiting Amsterdam (or Wageningen if you like)
* Go out with your smartphone (what else should you do during lunch), collect spatial information (for examples POIs on the campus) by tweeting from various locations using a specific hashtag (make sure location is enabled on your twitter account), harvest these tweets with an application, and create a map from it.
* .... think of something else.

Send in your application as a python script as well as a screenshot of the map you produced.

If you want to go beyond todays tutorials, have a look at some cookbooks and examples:
